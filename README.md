Overview

Mash-up web application leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) cycle data to inform debate on Cycle policy.
Barrier This Solves

The relevant barriers here are "fear of the road" due to a lack of good infrastructure and ignorance of the relative quality of cycle routes.

This hack doesn't fix the first, but by interrogating and providing a view of the massive data resource that the OSM represents, the data can help illuminate the debate over investment in infrastructure and assists the public in lobbying their political representatives by arming them with facts.

On the second barrier, by highlighting areas of official cycle routes that are "on-road" (i.e. no cycling facilities), this should help people to plan their journeys and to avoid potentially unpleasant experiences.
Detailed Description

The app provides an extensible collection of metrics and data visualisations relating to cycle infrastructure, aligned with political boundary data. The intial purpose of the application is to provide a baseline of current cycling infrastructure, including official cycle routes (NCN etc) as well as local paths.

The user enters his or her postcode and is presented with a map of their local political boundary*, with the current cycle infrastructure displayed. Stats and visualisations (charts etc) are displayed indicating metrics for the area, for example: + Proportion of cycle paths compared to total roads
+ proportion of cycle paths which are "On Road" i.e. not separated from the highway
+ more

Further metrics relevant to cycle infrastructure can be built as more detail is added to OSM - the success of the app is cogent on the effectiveness of crowd-sourcing more mapping information from cyclists and other road users. A possible second hack might envolve simplifying the method for inputting extra detail and making it much more convenient to do so.

(*) at the moment this defaults to Scottish Parliamentary constituency, but there is scope in future releases to add other levels of political power e.g. Ward, Council, UK Parliament and European Parliament.
